# Contrbuting

This repository is an open source project, and contributions and help from the community is strongly encouraged and important to improve the software. Contributions are therefore always welcome, no matter how large or small. Here are some things we'd like you to keep in mind in order to help with keeping the process smooth and organized.

## Adding a JSUI Example

To add an example, you will need to add to the list in the [README](https://github.com/jamesb93/JSUI-Showcase/blob/master/README.md) by creating a pull request.

### Style and Formatting Guidelines
- Each pull request should contain only one additional example.
- Search through the current examples to make sure you are not submitting a duplicate one.
- Though not necessary, ideally each example would link to a GitHub repository which contains documentation and code. 
- The format within the list is `[Title of Project | Author](https://link.com)` 
- Make sure the example is well documented! It should be clear how to use the example.

### Steps to Add an Example
1. Create a Github account if you do not already have one.
2. Fork this repository by clicking on the "Fork" button in the upper right-hand corner. You will now have your own version of this repository that you can edit.
3. Edit the README file, by clicking on the pencil icon in the upper-right hand corner, or by cloning your repository and editing the file locally. Commit your changes.
4. [Make a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request). Once you have committed your change, in your forked Github repository, you should see a message at the top that says something like "This branch is 1 commit ahead of Cycling74:master. Pull Request Compare". Click on the pull request button!
5. Wait eagerly for your example to be merged.
